Mobile ************************************************************
1. ACME (homework/acme-mobile)
  - new menu control
  - images get smaller
  - reduce margin

Resolution drops as screen gets smaller
  Desktop: > 800 pixels
  Tablet: 760 pixels
  Mobile: iphone: 375 wide pixels
1 pixel in css maybe more than 1 pixel on an iphone
You must build a design for each screen size

Min: 400 px wide (min width for desktop, max width for mobile)

"Mobile First Development": because mobile growth is good, most startups start with mobile design and then make changes for desktop later on.

At 400 px (breakpoint) there will be a whole set of different behavior at this juncture.
Target for Media queries

Media-Query
- screen (desktop)
- print (printer)
- max-width (starting with desktop, then next targetting mobile)
- min-width: (starting with mobile, then next targetting desktop)
- all

<link rel="stylesheet" href="all.css" media="screen">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print">

Typically you have
1. base starting point, most common rules
2. then you have separate styles for print/mobile/screen

For us, we start with screen as our base and later we'll customize for print & mobile

Print (how to make it look like it is not a website)
- extract text, border, box shadow
- kill the menu
CSS: display: none
Option 1: call out elements in css
Option 2: create a "dont-print" class



Local Storage *****************************************************
TODO List (todo-storage)
- local storage: still in browser but not in server
  - 5MB of storage, not good for images but good for text
  - string value that goes in and out of local storage.  you can't put in an array or an object. only a string.
  - an array has to be converted to a string: json.stringify()
  - string must be converted back to array: json.parse
  - local storage is a key value store: key is a string, value is a string
- cookies: but limited storage space, too small

localStorage Methods
- property: length (number) - how many items
- method: removeItem(key)
- method: setItem(key, value)
- method: getItem(key)

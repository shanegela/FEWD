Animations ******************************************

To move an element from point A to point B

- before CSS animation existed, this was done through javascript by making point A (position absolute left:0) and then add X in a time interval where X gets to Left: 800px.
- javascript function:
setInterval (function () {
  el.style.left = el.style.left + 1;
}, 100);
100 is the interval in which the function runs - 100 ms.

easing in/out: not a linear cadence, more life like.  stroll in and speed up. linear is the same speed.

now css has a property: transition
other css properties: poof, search for animation on developer.mozilla.org


css animation library: animate.css

CSS Preprocessors (less/sass) ******************************************
less is a language that gets turned into CSS
 - the javascript turns less into css in your browser
 - ruby can also parse the less into css (sprocket - smooshes all the files together)
 - manifest file to list files that you need and smooshes it together

less files lets you set variables
- examples: set variables that set color

mix colors: mix(@eggplan-color, white, 80%)
spin color spin(#starting-color, @step * 2) -> spin on the color wheel

lesscss.org


sass (sass-lang.com)

scss
- allows variables, not really used

coffescript

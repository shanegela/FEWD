Intro (you):  Hi, I'm Angie.  I took this course to broaden my technical skill set.

Intro (project): For my final project, I built a website that will show you the winning numbers 
and jackpot for three lottery games.  In california, the three draw games with the largest pot are superlotto plus, mega millions, and powerball.
So the website allows the user to select one of the three draw games.
It makes a request to the calottery api to get the last winning numbers and the jackpot for the next draw.
The site will also generate a quickpick ticket for you and you can specify your lucky numbers.

Code:  Some cool parts of the code:
  1. local storage - stores last selected game
  2. quickpick feature does validation on integer, range and duplicates
  3. API call uses a proxy server built by Avand to get around a security error for data coming from a different domain.

Conclude: This is phase 1 of 4 phases.  The next two phases are two build a backend to store the data and run analytics on the numbers.
And the final phase is to win the lottery.
